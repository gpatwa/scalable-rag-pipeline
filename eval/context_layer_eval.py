# eval/context_layer_eval.py
"""
Evaluation suite for Context Layer Architecture.

Measures how context enrichment improves answer quality by comparing
RAG responses with and without context layers enabled. Uses the LLM
judge to score answers on a 1-5 scale.

Metrics:
  - Accuracy improvement: does context make answers more precise?
  - Terminology consistency: does the answer use correct business terms?
  - Hallucination reduction: does context reduce fabricated claims?

Usage:
