# Enterprise Search and Recommendation OpenSearch Execution Plan

Status: Approved greenfield architecture; retrieval, rollout, and personalization through OS-079 implemented

Current implementation checkpoint (2026-08-22): OS-001 through OS-035 are merged;
OS-036 provides a separate search worker deployable, OS-037 provides checkpointed
backfill and dry-run commands, OS-038 provides bounded source/index reconciliation,
OS-039 gates generation alias swaps on reconciliation results, OS-040 provides an
allowlisted tenant/ACL filter compiler, OS-041 provides scoped BM25 lexical
retrieval with exact-ID and phrase boosts, and OS-042 through OS-048 provide
filtered vector retrieval, deterministic hybrid RRF, stable lexical pagination,
bounded provider orchestration, and an opt-in support integration. OS-070
through OS-079 add consented interaction events, deterministic feature
materialization, policy-aware reranking, recommendation metrics, and guarded
experiments. These milestones are locally tested with provider fakes; live
OpenSearch integration remains gated by the later local integration and
deployment packets.
Audience: Engineering leads, reviewers, and delegated coding models
Scope: Agentic Search and Support Resolution Intelligence under `services/api`,
`apps/support-web`, and their deployment assets

## 1. Executive Decision

Use OpenSearch as the enterprise search plane for lexical, vector, hybrid,
filtered, personalized, and recommendation-candidate retrieval.

PostgreSQL and object storage remain authoritative. OpenSearch is a rebuildable,
derived index. Neo4j remains the relationship and knowledge-graph store.
Qdrant is retained only as a temporary local/demo fixture while the OpenSearch
path is built. There is no customer-facing backward-compatibility promise and
no requirement to preserve Qdrant as a production fallback.

This is a pre-customer greenfield launch. Breaking API, mapping, persistence,
and provider changes are allowed when they improve the target architecture.
Operational recovery still requires idempotency, auditability, fail-closed
authorization, and alias rollback for incomplete or failed index operations.

Do not place OpenSearch-specific types in support domain models. All product
code must depend on a versioned search contract so the backend remains
replaceable.

## 2. Product Outcome

An authorized enterprise user can search tickets, comments, articles, files,
and approved business context with exact-term and semantic recall. Results are
permission-trimmed, tenant-scoped, explainable, and suitable for an agent to use
as evidence. The same retrieval platform can generate personalized and
recommendation candidates without becoming the system of record for customer
data or behavioral events.

The first production release succeeds when it can:

- Return exact identifiers, error strings, product names, and phrases through
  BM25 retrieval.
- Return semantically related content through vector retrieval.
- Fuse lexical and vector candidates deterministically.
- Apply tenant and document ACL filters before scoring results.
- Preserve source, model, schema, permission, and index versions in every trace.
- Rebuild an index from canonical data without losing authoritative state.
- Compare against the existing Qdrant plus lexical implementation offline while
  building confidence in the new path.
- Produce recommendation candidates using explicit behavioral and business
  signals without leaking one tenant's activity into another tenant.

## 3. Current Baseline

Available now:

- Qdrant vector indexing and retrieval behind `VectorDBClient`.
- A dependency-light Python BM25-style support search implementation.
- Reciprocal-rank fusion of vector and lexical results.
- Canonical support tickets, comments, articles, durable jobs, and audit events.
- Mandatory tenant filters in the support search path.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, Neo4j, S3/Blob, Docker Compose, Helm, and Terraform.

Production gaps:

- Lexical search loads a bounded candidate set into the API process and ranks it
  in Python. It is suitable for demos, not enterprise corpus scale.
- The vector contract cannot express text queries, hybrid ranking, ACL scopes,
  aggregations, index versions, or ranking explanations.
- Index writes are coupled to application workflows rather than a durable
  outbox with replay and reconciliation.
- There is no OpenSearch client, mapping, index lifecycle, alias, deployment,
  benchmark, or runbook.
- Personalization and recommendation events, features, policies, and evaluation
  are not yet product contracts.

### System-of-record boundaries

| Concern | Authoritative source |
|---|---|
| Tickets, comments, articles, users, actions | PostgreSQL/source helpdesk |
| Raw files and lake objects | S3, ADLS, or customer lake |
| Embeddings and searchable fields | Rebuildable OpenSearch index |
| Relationship graph | Neo4j, rebuildable from canonical records |
| User/group identity | Customer identity provider |
| Document permission assignments | Source system and normalized ACL record |
| Search and interaction events | PostgreSQL event store initially |
| Derived popularity/profile features | Versioned feature materialization |
| Search audit evidence | Append-only Compass audit store |

### Required search contract

Every query must include a `SearchScope` containing:

- `tenant_id` with no production default.
- `principal_id` and normalized group or ACL tokens.
- `purpose` and product surface.
- Optional provider, status, source type, time, and classification filters.

Every result must include:

- Stable document and source identifiers.
- Normalized score plus lexical, vector, and fusion components when available.
- Source URI, title, text excerpt, and metadata.
- Retrieval method and ranking explanation summary.
- Index schema, embedding model, content, and permission versions.

### Index topology

- Use one versioned physical index per product domain and schema generation.
- Point a stable read alias and write alias to the active generation.
- Use mandatory `tenant_id` and `acl_tokens` fields in shared indexes.
- Allow a tenant registry to route regulated or very large tenants to dedicated
  indexes without changing the query contract.
- Never create one index per tenant by default; uncontrolled shard growth is an
  operational failure mode.

## 5. Architectural Constraints

1. Fail closed when tenant or ACL scope is missing or malformed.
2. Use an outbox and idempotent worker; do not rely on request-path dual writes.
3. Keep provider payloads out of API response contracts.
4. Version mappings, embeddings, analyzers, ranking configuration, and features.
5. Use aliases for zero-downtime reindex and operational rollback.
6. Redact or exclude prohibited content before indexing.
7. Keep recommendation behavior events out of document payloads unless a
   reviewed feature contract explicitly materializes them.
8. OpenSearch is first-stage retrieval. Business policy and final reranking stay
   in Compass.
9. Qdrant retirement is an implementation decision, not a customer compatibility gate.
10. No analytics product imports. Shared primitives belong in
    `packages/platform_contracts` only when both products actually consume them.

## 6. Delivery Gates

| Gate | Exit evidence |
|---|---|
| G0: Contract | Provider-neutral models, fake provider, and conformance tests pass |
| G1: Index | Versioned mapping, aliases, outbox, worker, replay, and delete paths pass |
| G2: Retrieval | BM25, vector, hybrid, ACL, filters, and explanations pass golden tests |
| G3: Relevance baseline | Offline Qdrant/OpenSearch comparison establishes recall, ranking, ACL, and latency evidence |
| G4: Canary | Isolation, relevance, p95 latency, failure, and rollback gates pass |
| G5: Personalization | Event, feature, policy, candidate, and evaluation contracts pass |
| G6: Production | SLO, DR, security, cost, operations, and customer acceptance pass |

## 7. Atomic Execution Tasks

Each task is intended for one lower-capability coding model in one fresh
worktree. A task must not be combined with another task unless the dispatch
table explicitly says it shares ownership.

| Wave | Tasks that may run in parallel | Required merge order |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | OS-001, OS-005 | Merge both before contract implementation |
| 1 | OS-002 then OS-003; OS-006 independently | OS-002 -> OS-003 -> OS-004 -> OS-007 |
| 2 | OS-010, OS-011, OS-020 | Merge config/dependency/schema before provider work |
| 3 | OS-012 to OS-015 sequential; OS-021 independently | Provider foundation before index lifecycle |

## 9. Delegation Rules

Give a delegated model exactly one task ID and this plan. Require it to:

1. Read the task, dependencies, owned files, and directly related existing code.
2. Stop if a dependency is missing from its branch.
3. Modify only owned files plus the smallest necessary import/export file.
4. Follow the target contract; breaking changes are allowed before customer launch.
5. Add focused tests before reporting completion.
6. Run the targeted tests, API suite, and `git diff --check`.
7. Commit with `feat(search): OS-NNN short description` or the appropriate
   `test`, `docs`, `fix`, or `chore` type.
8. Report changed files, tests, assumptions, and unresolved risks.

Delegated models must not:

- Deploy cloud resources.
- Change production traffic or defaults.
- Remove Qdrant or Python lexical fallback except in the explicit retirement task.
- Weaken tenant, ACL, TLS, authentication, or audit behavior.
- Add Elasticsearch clients or Elastic-specific APIs.
- Introduce a second task's deliverable opportunistically.
- Reformat unrelated files or edit analytics product code.

## 10. Model-Ready Prompt Template

```text
Implement task OS-NNN from
docs/ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_OPENSEARCH_EXECUTION_PLAN.md.

Repository rules:
- Work only in the task's owned files and the smallest required import/export.
- Do not implement later tasks.
- Build toward the target contract; do not add customer compatibility shims.
- Never allow a query without tenant and ACL scope.
- Do not deploy or change production configuration defaults.
- Add focused tests for success, failure, tenant isolation, and idempotency where applicable.

Before editing:
1. Confirm every dependency listed for OS-NNN exists in this branch.
2. Read the owned files and their current tests.
3. If a dependency or required contract is absent, stop and report exactly what is missing.

Before handoff, run:
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/services/api:$PWD" pytest <targeted-test-files> -q
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/services/api:$PWD" pytest services/api/tests -q
git diff --check

Commit the result using:
<type>(search): OS-NNN <short description>

Return:
- commit hash
- changed files
- tests and results
- assumptions
- remaining risks or follow-up task IDs
```

## 11. Review Protocol

Every implementation task requires a separate review model or human reviewer.
The reviewer should inspect, in order:

1. Tenant and ACL fail-closed behavior.
2. Idempotency, replay, deletion, and error recovery.
3. Public contract compatibility and provider leakage.
4. Test quality, including negative and cross-tenant cases.
5. Operational bounds: timeouts, retries, batch sizes, memory, and logging.
6. Scope compliance with the task packet.

A task is not complete merely because tests pass. The owned acceptance evidence
must be visible in the commit.

## 12. Integration Gates

Run from the repository root after every merge wave:

```bash
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/services/api:$PWD" pytest services/api/tests -q
npm --prefix apps/support-web run typecheck
npm --prefix apps/support-web test -- --run
git diff --check
```

When OpenSearch integration tests exist:

```bash
docker compose --profile opensearch up -d opensearch
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/services/api:$PWD" pytest services/api/tests -m opensearch -q
docker compose --profile opensearch stop opensearch
```

Infrastructure changes additionally require:

```bash
helm lint deploy/helm/api
terraform fmt -check -recursive infra/terraform
terraform -chdir=infra/terraform/azure validate
```

## 13. Human Approval Checkpoints

Lower-capability models may prepare evidence but may not make these decisions:

- Select the Azure OpenSearch operating model or commercial provider.
- Approve index topology exceptions for dedicated tenants.
- Set production relevance, latency, availability, or cost thresholds.
- Approve customer data and behavioral-event retention.
- Enable canary traffic or production cutover.
- Remove Qdrant before the explicit retirement task and local validation gate.

## 14. Initial Definition of Done

The roadmap itself is execution-ready when:

- Every implementation item has one deliverable, dependencies, ownership, and
  acceptance evidence.
- Merge waves prevent known file collisions.
- Delegated prompts contain stop conditions and validation commands.
- Human-only decisions are explicit.
- There is no customer compatibility requirement. Local defaults may change
  after the relevant OpenSearch validation gate is approved.
