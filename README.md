Compass contains two independently deployable products built on explicit shared
contracts: Resolution Intelligence for support teams and conversational
analytics for commerce operators. Product APIs, web apps, tests, configuration,
and release gates are isolated even though they share one repository.

### Why This Platform

| Business Need | How It's Solved |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Reduce repeat support work** | Support Resolution turns tickets and knowledge into cited playbooks, reviewed commands, local execution artifacts, and audit history |
| **Ask business questions** | The standalone Analytics product generates guarded read-only SQL and renders result tables, charts, and SQL evidence |
| **Multimodal understanding** | Gemini Embedding supports text + image retrieval — ingest PDFs with diagrams, photos, screenshots alongside text documents |
| **Business context that makes answers useful** | 4-layer Context Architecture (glossary, metadata, code/pipeline, business rules) enriches every response with institutional knowledge |
| **Data residency & compliance** | Control Plane / Data Plane split — customer data never leaves their cloud region; mTLS secures every cross-plane call |
| **Zero vendor lock-in** | Provider-abstraction layer — swap LLMs (vLLM ↔ OpenAI), vector DBs, storage, and secrets backends with a single env var |
| **Multi-tenant SaaS at scale** | Per-tenant auth, rate limiting, usage metering, and isolated data planes — onboard new customers without redeploying |
| **Multi-cloud portability** | Identical codebase deploys to AWS EKS and Azure AKS with cloud-specific Terraform, Helm, and secrets integrations |

### Technology Stack

Built on **FastAPI**, **React**, **LangGraph**, **Qdrant**, **Neo4j**,
**PostgreSQL**, **Ray/vLLM**, and **Vega-Lite**, with versioned Pydantic
contracts under `packages/platform_contracts`.

## Quick Start (Local Development)

```bash
# 1. Install Python dependencies
make install

# 2. Start local databases (Postgres, Redis, Qdrant, Neo4j, MinIO)
make up

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env: set LLM_PROVIDER, EMBED_MODEL, etc.

# 4. Initialize datastores (tables, collections, indexes, buckets)
make init

# 5. Ingest sample documents
python3 scripts/ingest_local.py --sample

# 6. Start the support API and web app in separate terminals
make dev
make dev-support-web
```

Open the support product at `http://localhost:5173/` and its API at
`http://localhost:8080/`.

For analytics, load the demo dataset and start its independent deployables:

```bash
make seed-olist
make dev-analytics-api
make dev-analytics-web
```

Open Analytics at `http://localhost:5174/` and its API at
`http://localhost:8090/`.

| Component       | Service                 | Port        |
|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| LLM + Embed    | Ollama or OpenAI API   | 11434 / API |
| Vector DB      | Qdrant (Docker)        | 6333        |
| Graph DB       | Neo4j (Docker)         | 7474 / 7687 |
| SQL DB         | Postgres (Docker)      | 5432        |
| Cache          | Redis (Docker)         | 6379        |
| Object Storage | MinIO (Docker)         | 9000 / 9001 |

## Architecture Overview

```text
apps/support-web       -> services/api              -> support data + retrieval
apps/analytics-web     -> services/analytics-api    -> read-only analytics DB
                                  |
                                  v
                    packages/platform_contracts
```

The support API does not import, initialize, route, or stream analytics code.
The analytics API owns SQL generation, schema grounding, safety checks, and
chart result contracts.

### Control Plane / Data Plane (SaaS Mode)

For multi-tenant SaaS deployments with data residency requirements, the platform splits into two independent services:

```
                     +---------------------------+
                     |     Control Plane (SaaS)  |
                     |  Auth, Routing, Rate Limit|
                     |  Tenant & Usage Mgmt      |
                     +------+--------+-----------+
                            |        |
               REST + mTLS  |        |  REST + mTLS
                            v        v
              +-------------+--+  +--+-------------+
              | Data Plane A   |  | Data Plane B   |
              | Customer: Acme |  | Customer: Globex|
              | Region: eu-w-1 |  | Region: us-e-1 |
              | LLM + Qdrant + |  | LLM + Qdrant + |
              | Neo4j + PG     |  | Neo4j + PG     |
              +----------------+  +----------------+
```

| Mode | `DEPLOYMENT_MODE` | Use Case |
|------|-------------------|----------|
| `monolith` | (default) | Single-instance dev/prod |
| `control_plane` | CP only | SaaS management: auth, routing, proxy, admin |
| `data_plane` | DP only | Customer-deployed: query processing, single-tenant |

See [Architecture docs](docs/architecture.md#11-control-plane--data-plane-architecture) for full details.

### Key Design Principles

- **Agentic reasoning** via LangGraph state machine (plan, retrieve, respond, evaluate)
- **Hybrid retrieval** combining vector search (Qdrant) + knowledge graph (Neo4j) + optional re-ranking
- **Dedicated embedding model** (`nomic-embed-text` / `bge-m3`) separate from the generative LLM
- **Multi-cloud** --- identical codebase runs on AWS EKS or Azure AKS
- **Multi-tenant** --- per-tenant data isolation, config, rate limits, and auth
- **Control plane / data plane** --- SaaS-ready split with data residency, mTLS, per-tenant rate limiting
- **Context layer enrichment** --- optional 4-layer business context (glossary, metadata, code/pipeline, business rules) injected at query time
- **Product isolation** --- separate API/web containers, configuration, tests, and CI gates
- **Shared contracts** --- versioned request/response models without cross-product domain imports
- **Provider-abstraction** --- every component (LLM, storage, vector DB, secrets, reranker) is swappable via env vars

### Provider Abstraction

| Component | Env Var | Options |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| LLM | `LLM_PROVIDER` | `ray` (self-hosted vLLM), `openai` |
| Embeddings | `EMBED_PROVIDER` / `EMBED_MODEL` | `ray` + `nomic-embed-text`, `openai` + `text-embedding-3-small` |
| Re-ranker | `RERANKER_PROVIDER` | `none`, `llm` (LLM-based scoring), `cross_encoder` (dedicated model) |
| Context Layers | `CONTEXT_LAYERS_ENABLED` | `false` (off), `true` (glossary, metadata, code, business rules) |
| Vector DB | `VECTORDB_PROVIDER` | `qdrant` |
| Graph DB | `GRAPHDB_PROVIDER` | `neo4j`, `none` (disable) |
| Storage | `STORAGE_PROVIDER` | `s3` (AWS), `azure_blob` (Azure) |
| Secrets | `SECRETS_PROVIDER` | `env`, `aws_sm` (Secrets Manager), `azure_kv` (Key Vault) |
